# Generative Data by Generative Agents

Simulation of virtual agents, worlds and sensors using LLMs.

## Usage

The [Main.ipynb](Main.ipynb) notebook shows the process of starting an agent and simulation world, and the [Analisys.ipynb](Analisys.ipynb) notebook shows some data processing that can be done with the simulation results.

An example of data to create the simulation is available at [Generative Data by Generative Agents - First Simulation Data ![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.12601359.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12601359).
